This project was created for our Machine Learning class. We used different supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to determine the outcome and to analyze the 2016 Presidential Election while using different data visualizations techniques to paint a better picture of the election within counties.

## Conclusion
Random forest performed the best out of all our classifiers. The model had a 95% accuracy rate when tested on our test set. For comparison our next best classifier was the decision tree classifier which had a 93% accuracy rate. However, our QDA classifier did the worst among all models. All in all, with our best predictive model we were able to classify 95% the states correctly.
