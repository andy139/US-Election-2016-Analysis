## Conclusion
Random forest performed the best out of all our classifiers.The model had a 95% accuracy rate when tested on our test set. For comparison our next best classifier was the decision tree classifier which had a 93% accuracy rate. However, our QDA classifier did the worst among all models. All in all, with our best predictive model we were able to classify 95% the states correctly.
